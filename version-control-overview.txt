The meaning of version control
 Version control is a system that records and manages changes to files — most commonly source code — so you can track history, compare versions, and return to earlier states if needed. At its core it stores a sequence of snapshots (commits) and metadata (who changed what and when), and supports branching so multiple lines of work can proceed independently.
The benefit of Version Control
 collaboration safety: multiple developers can work on the same codebase without overwriting each other’s work. It also provides an auditable history (who introduced a change and why), enables reproducible rollbacks when bugs are found, and makes code review and continuous integration possible
Example of version control and description
 Example in a software team: when a developer implements a new feature, they create a feature branch (isolated workspace), make incremental commits as they code, then push the branch to the central repository and open a pull request.
 eammates review the changes, run automated tests, request fixes if necessary, and after approval the branch is merged into main.
Command used in version control and explanation 
 From VS Code you can run this in the integrated terminal (View → Terminal) or use the Source Control view to create branches, stage changes, and commit. For example, in the terminal run:
git add .
git commit -m "Add login UI and validation"
git push -u origin feature/login

This demonstrates how version control supports incremental, reviewable, and reversible development in practical team workflows.
